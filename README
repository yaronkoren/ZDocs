== About ==

ZDocs is a MediaWiki extension that lets you store well-structured
documentation within the wiki by grouping pages into products,
product versions, manuals and individual topic pages. Its
structure is based on that of the PonyDocs extension, although it
has a simpler approach to defining the structure.

== Credits ==

The ZDocs extension was created by Yaron Koren. Its overall concept
of four page types is based on the PonyDocs extension.
